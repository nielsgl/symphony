# Agent Review Lenses

This file defines the review lenses for this repository. Symphony's workflow
requires evidence-backed Agent Review artifacts; this project-owned document
defines which lenses reviewers must consider and when they are triggered.

Use the lenses as an adversarial review tool, not as a checklist to rubber
stamp. A reviewer may mark a triggered lens as not applicable only when the
review artifact explains why the trigger does not affect the current diff.

## Required Artifact

Agent Review comments must follow the artifact shape in `WORKFLOW.md`:

- Scope Read
- Independent Invariants
- Acceptance Criteria Mapping
- Triggered Review Lenses
- Findings
- Verdict

Each triggered lens row must include concrete evidence: files, functions,
tests, commands, screenshots, PR comments, or runtime paths inspected. Passing
tests alone are validation evidence; they do not replace lens evidence.

## Base Lenses

### Acceptance Criteria

Trigger: every implementation PR.

Review question: does the implementation satisfy the issue's actual acceptance
criteria, including negative cases and evidence requirements?

Evidence examples: issue checklist mapping, PR diff, focused tests, validation
commands, UI evidence comments.

### Production Wiring

Trigger: any feature depends on config, bootstrap, adapters, API routes,
dashboard state, persistence, external commands, or runtime services.

Review question: is the behavior reachable through the real production path, or
only through direct construction, mocks, fixtures, or test-only seams?

Symphony examples: workflow resolver to runtime bootstrap wiring, Local API
routes to runtime managers, persistence migrations to SQLite stores.

### State Transitions And Invariants

Trigger: any change adds, changes, or depends on state, lifecycle, routing,
status, or health semantics.

Review question: what must always remain true, and what transitions must be
impossible?

Evidence examples: state machine code, transition guards, refusal reason codes,
tests for invalid transitions.

### Multi-Phase Mutation

Trigger: workflows with separate phases such as prepare/apply, claim/complete,
start/finish, drain/restart, schedule/execute, detect/remediate, or
approve/merge.

Review question: is the candidate or object accepted in the first phase pinned
or revalidated before later mutation?

Evidence examples: stored operation identity, compare-before-apply checks,
re-prepare refusal tests, audit entries binding intent to the acted-on object.

### Failure And Refusal Paths

Trigger: every implementation PR with runtime behavior.

Review question: do named failure, refusal, timeout, offline, mismatch,
permission, and unavailable paths return deterministic operator-visible states?

Evidence examples: typed error envelopes, refusal reason codes, negative-path
tests, dashboard or diagnostics projection.

### Idempotency, Retry, And Concurrency

Trigger: any API, button, scheduler, worker loop, retry loop, external webhook,
or command can run more than once or overlap with another actor.

Review question: what happens on duplicate clicks, repeated API calls, resumed
agents, replays, retries, and concurrent operators?

Evidence examples: in-flight guards, terminal-result replay, duplicate-request
tests, concurrency tests, persisted idempotency keys.

### External Integration

Trigger: changes touch GitHub, Linear, Codex app-server, filesystem/process
APIs, network APIs, package managers, shells, or generated external contracts.

Review question: are availability, auth, rate limits, stale remote state,
schema drift, partial responses, and fallback policy handled explicitly?

Evidence examples: mocked integration states plus real adapter/bootstrap path,
bounded timeouts, redacted diagnostics, contract freshness checks.

### Control-Plane Hot Path

Trigger: changes touch state, diagnostics, dashboard polling, SSE snapshots,
health checks, dispatch loops, scheduler loops, issue polling, or local API
responsiveness.

Review question: can a normal control-plane read block on slow IO, network,
child processes, builds, installs, broad filesystem scans, or unbounded work?

Evidence examples: cache/TTL behavior, async/background refresh, bounded scan
tests, stress tests, request-latency or event-loop diagnostics.

### Persistence And Auditability

Trigger: behavior claims to survive restart, write history, provide forensics,
support replay, or expose durable audit facts.

Review question: does the durable schema, migration path, projection, and
restart/reopen behavior support the claim?

Evidence examples: real store tests, migration tests from older schema,
close/reopen tests, bounded/redacted payload checks.

### Security, Secrets, And Shell Execution

Trigger: external input reaches shell commands, filesystem paths, environment,
logs, history payloads, token data, credentials, or approval/sandbox policy.

Review question: is input passed safely, are secrets redacted, and are trust
boundaries explicit?

Evidence examples: `shell:false`, argv arrays, path containment checks,
redaction tests, environment omission, approval policy tests.

### UI And Operator Workflow

Trigger: user-visible UI behavior, layout, styling, interaction, copy, loading,
error, empty states, dashboard controls, or operator decision flows changed.

Review question: can the operator understand the current state, the next safe
action, and why actions are enabled or refused?

Evidence examples: rendered Linear media, Playwright screenshots or videos,
dashboard tests, accessibility and responsive layout checks.

### Refactor Boundary Preservation

Trigger: move-only changes, extractions, facade preservation, module splits,
large-file decomposition, or architecture-boundary tickets.

Review question: did ownership move to the intended module without behavior
drift, helper-only shuffles, hidden service-locator coupling, or public API
breakage?

Evidence examples: before/after line counts, facade exports, public import
tests, boundary grep checks, behavior-equivalence tests.

### Generated Asset And Freshness

Trigger: committed generated files, bundled assets, schemas, API clients,
snapshots, manifests, or generated docs changed or are required to stay fresh.

Review question: is the generated output reproducible and guarded against stale
commits?

Evidence examples: `--check` freshness command, deterministic generator tests,
source-to-generated diff evidence, CI/meta gate wiring.

### Metric And Telemetry Semantics

Trigger: counters, timings, health states, diagnostics, dashboards, logs, or
budget/token telemetry changed.

Review question: does the metric measure the named behavior, and are sentinel,
reset, empty, aggregate-only, and unavailable states semantically correct?

Evidence examples: semantic tests with controlled timing/state, reset tests,
projection tests, docs matching emitted fields.

### Test Adequacy

Trigger: every implementation PR.

Review question: do tests cover the real path, happy path, negative paths,
regressions, production wiring, and the highest-risk lens scenarios?

Evidence examples: focused test list, full validation, real-path integration
tests, explicit rationale for untested areas.

## Project-Specific Lenses

Add project-specific lenses below when a recurring risk is too domain-specific
for the base lenses. Keep each project-specific lens tied to triggers and
evidence, not preferences.

### Symphony Runtime Upgrade Safety

Trigger: Symphony drain, restart, reload, runtime update, dispatch safety, or
quiescence behavior changed.

Review question: can active work continue safely until a real boundary, and are
mutations blocked until Drain Mode and quiescence gates are still true?

Evidence examples: Drain Mode gates across dispatch paths, quiescence blocker
tests, candidate pinning for update phases, runtime identity projections.

### Symphony Workflow Governance

Trigger: Linear/GitHub workflow routing, Agent Review, Human Review, Merging,
workpads, PR governance, or handoff/fresh-dispatch behavior changed.

Review question: does the workflow state machine preserve ownership boundaries,
review routing, governed PR submission, and finalization evidence?

Evidence examples: workflow text tests, tracker adapter behavior, PR body/meta
checks, state-transition tests.
